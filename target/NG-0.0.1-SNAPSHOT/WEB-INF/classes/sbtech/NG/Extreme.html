					<h2> COLOR MATCH EXTREME </h2>
					<hr>
					<p> Color Match Extreme is a lot different in this extreme mode rather then the previous level. This will come a lot harder, so make sure your eyes are prepared to see the differences within the colors that appear. There has been a lot more added to this game mode. A timer, a score and the sheer power of knowing the true colors before your eye.</p>
					<p>Click Play to start the game:</p>

					<h2>Puzzle Extreme </h2>
					<hr>
					<p> If you would like a another challenge go ahead and try to complete this puzzle. Everything might not be in place yet, but try to complete this puzzle with as little amount of move possible. Note: The puzzle does change every time, so it will never be the same as someone else who attempts. NOTE: This game is still in Development, but have fun! </p>
